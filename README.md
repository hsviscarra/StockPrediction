# 🧠 Stock Prediction & Fundamental Analysis Platform

A robust, scalable, and cloud-native pipeline for predicting stock prices and analyzing financial fundamentals using **free data sources like Yahoo Finance**. This project integrates the best MLOps and data engineering practices for research, deployment, and monitoring.

---

## 📌 1. Problem Description

Stock prediction is a long-standing challenge that combines quantitative modeling, macroeconomic insights, and technical analysis. This project aims to:

- Predict future stock prices using machine learning.
- Analyze companies based on fundamental indicators (e.g., P/E ratio, EPS, ROE).
- Enable long-term and short-term investment decision support.
- Deliver predictions via a production-grade pipeline.

**Why this matters:**

- Helps retail and institutional investors make informed decisions.
- Offers a framework to test trading strategies with historical & live data.
- Demonstrates real-world MLOps for time-series forecasting.

---

## ☁️ 2. Cloud Architecture (AWS)

The project is cloud-ready and leverages AWS services such as:

- **S3**: Raw & processed data storage
- **ECR**: Container image registry
- **ECS / EKS**: Model & pipeline deployment (Docker/Kubernetes)
- **CloudWatch**: Monitoring & logging
- **SageMaker (optional)**: Alternative for training/deploying ML models

The entire project is containerized and deployable using **Docker or Kubernetes**.

---

## 🛠️ 3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

All infrastructure is provisioned via **Terraform**, enabling reproducible environments.

- `terraform/`
  - `main.tf`: Main configuration
  - `modules/`: Reusable infrastructure modules (S3, EKS, IAM roles, etc.)
  - `backend.tf`: Remote state management (e.g., S3 + DynamoDB)

---

## 🔬 4. Experiment Tracking & Model Registry

- **MLflow** is used for:
  - Tracking model experiments (params, metrics, artifacts)
  - Registering models with version control
  - Comparing and selecting the best-performing model

> UI accessible via localhost or deployed MLflow server in AWS

---

## 🛠️ 5. Workflow Orchestration

- **Apache Airflow** manages and schedules:
  - Daily data ingestion from Yahoo Finance
  - Feature engineering pipelines
  - Model training, evaluation, and deployment
  - Conditional tasks (e.g., retraining if performance degrades)

---

## 🚀 6. Model Deployment

- Model is served using:
  - **FastAPI** or **Flask** (RESTful API)
  - Dockerized container
  - Deployed via ECS, EKS, or on-premise Kubernetes
  - CI/CD pipeline ensures automatic deployments

Optional tools:
- **SageMaker** or **AWS Lambda** for model inference

---

## 🧭 7. Model Monitoring

- **Evidently AI** tracks:
  - Data drift
  - Prediction drift
  - Feature importance changes
- **Alerts** via:
  - Slack/Email notifications
  - Airflow-triggered retraining workflows
  - Auto-switching to backup models (blue/green deployment)

---

## 🔁 8. Reproducibility

- Clear documentation and `Makefile` for setup and training
- `requirements.txt` and `environment.yml` specify exact dependency versions
- Sample `.env.example` file for secrets and configs
- Dockerfile ensures consistent environment across dev/staging/prod

## 🧪 9. Best Practices

| Area              | Tools / Techniques                                      |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Unit Testing      | `pytest` + `unittest`                                    |
| Integration Tests | End-to-end tests for data flow and predictions           |
| Code Formatting   | `black`, `isort`, `flake8`, `pylint`                     |
| Pre-commit Hooks  | Auto-formatting, linting, and secret scanning            |
| CI/CD             | GitHub Actions / GitLab CI to test, build, and deploy    |
| Project Structure | Modular folder structure with clear separation of concerns |
| Makefile          | Reusable command recipes (e.g., `make train`, `make test`) |
